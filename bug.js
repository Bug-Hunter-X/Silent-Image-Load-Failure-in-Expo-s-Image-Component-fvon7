This error occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a URI that's not properly formatted or accessible.  It's often masked by a generic error message, making debugging difficult. The image may appear broken or not load at all.  The root cause could be a typo in the URI, a network issue preventing access, or incorrect authorization to access the image resource.

```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/image.jpg' }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
```
